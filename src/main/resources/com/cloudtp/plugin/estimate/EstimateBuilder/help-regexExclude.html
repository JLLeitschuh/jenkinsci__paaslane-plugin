  The "Exclude Regular Expressions" field contains a comma separated list of regular expression patterns that will 
  be applied to every matched artifact. If any of the patterns match the path of the artifact being reviewed, then 
  that artifact will not be sent to PaaSLane. Examples of these regular expressions can be found 
  <a href="http://ocpsoft.org/opensource/guide-to-regular-expressions-in-java-part-1/">here.</a>
